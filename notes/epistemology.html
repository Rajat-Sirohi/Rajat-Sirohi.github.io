<h2 id="org9971f8b"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> What's wrong with total skepticism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
If we adopt a Platonic notion of Truth, as that which conforms with what's "out there" then we are either relegated to explaining how we have knowledge of what's "out there" or else presupposing it. The only alternative is total skepticism. If you think that Truth is inaccessible then it follows that knowledge is impossible (since knowledge entails justified true belief at the very least, and we can't be justified in our beliefs if we don't have any unerstanding of what is true. If we simply believe something which happens to be true without any justification then that's not knowledge). How do you know that knowledge is impossible? You might claim that we don't know this and are simply relegated to a realm of complete ignorance. This is totally in opposition to our understanding of the world though. If we truly were completely ignorant, how could we have made such tremendous accomplishments in the realm of science and technology, for example? Or what about knowledge of basic truths like the laws of logic? To adopt total skepticism is to reject everything we putatively know about the world on the basis of mere possibility. It's not rational much less helpful.
</p>

<p>
Let's say I am a brain in a vat or a "deluded person" living a lie whose life is in fact controlled by some duplicituous demon aiming to deceive me. SO WHAT? I still know at base value that I am experiencing something. This is an unassailable truth, not susceptible to skepticism. Whether this experience comports to some notion of "reality" or not is frankly irrelevant. What I'm concerned with is the nature of this experience and the understanding of the world (whether a dream world or so-called "reality") which it affords. Ultimately, the skeptical concerns are deemed insignificant and irrelevant. I'm happy to either dismiss them or placate them and just move on with my epistemology.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, note the extent to which the skeptical conclusion relies on increasingly absurd counter-factuals. The apparent regularity and uniformity of our experiences lends creedence to the notion that we are not in fact being deceived. Of course, it's POSSIBLE that this duplicituous demon is just toying with us and trying to get us to fallaciously gain confidence in our experiences only to deceive us in some other unnoticed way. Sure, it's possible but why should I doubt my entire understanding of the world on the basis of a mere possibility? Of course, we only need to go here (i.e. to some sort of presuppositionalist / faith based foundation) if we don't accept the above paragraph, i.e. that "reality" as a notion is unhelpful; even if I'm being "deceived" in some unnoticed way, my understanding of the world is limited to my experiences and <i>a priori</i> knowledge. Whether this comports with the "reality" of the demon or not, it constitutes and defines MY reality and the reality of everybody else who shares my experiences and <i>a priori</i> knowledge. What more could we demand of reality? If we persist in some mind-independent reality, we can still get that but we then need to rely on the presupposition / faith that our experiences and <i>a priori</i> knowledge are reliable. But, I don't see any reason to go that far anyways.

<h2 id="orgf55c2cb"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> What is Truth?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Given the untenability of skepticism, what then do we mean by Truth? Well, one way to explore what we mean by Truth is by exploring what we claim to <b>know</b>. If we <b>know</b> <i>X</i>, then it follows that <i>X</i> is <b>true</b> (truth is an aspect of knowledge). Note, that we needn't know anything with absolute certainty. Nevertheless, our confidence in our <b>knowledge</b> of <i>X</i> should be proportional to our confidence in the <b>truth</b> of <i>X</i>. I've already explained why we have good reasons to believe that we have knowledge of some things. It therefore follows that we know some things to be true.
</p>

<p>
So, what kinds of things do we have knowledge of? Well, take the basic laws of logic, say the <i>law of noncontradiction</i>. It seems utterly reasonable to propose that we <b>know</b> the <i>law of noncontradiction</i> and that therefore the <i>law of noncontradiction</i> is <b>true</b>. What would it mean to be skeptical of this knowledge? We could say that perhaps the <i>law of noncontradiction</i> is just a mental construction. Without minds, it would not exist. Okay&#x2026; I have no problem with that. I'm not trying to be that <i>metaphysically ambitious</i>. <b>All I mean by <i>X</i> is true is that <i>X</i> properly describes the world as understood</b>. One way in which we understand the world is through experience. The <i>law of noncontradiction</i> unfailingly describes the world as we experience it, and so we say it's <b>true</b>.
</p>

<p>
At what other levels do we understand the world? One big way is science. <b>Science refines our experiential understanding</b> to offer us an understanding of the principles of nature and the world. Note, it is not an <i>alternative</i> method <i>per se</i>. Rather, it presupposes some principles which we adopt on the basis of our experiential understanding (e.g. laws of logic and mathematics, principle of induction, etc.) and leads us to further truths which are otherwise too complex (i.e. not basic) to believe on the basis of experience alone. It furthermore allows us to examine other beliefs founded in experience alone and to scrutinize them.
</p>

<p>
For example, take the experientially derived claim that <b>women are stupid</b>. A man's experience with every woman he knows has led him to this conclusion. He is indeed justified in this belief until futher scrutiny lends creedence to its negation. Indeed, through scientific investigation, we can compare some relevant metrics of intelligence and gather data on their distribution with respect to the sexes. Our notions of intelligence will be experientally guided and our justification of the scientific method is experientally founded, but the combination of these leads us to actually reject an otherwise experientially derived claim. That is, we conclude <b>women are not actually stupid</b>. In this way, we are never going beyond our experiences <i>per se</i> but just utilizing more refined methods of investigation to scrutinze experiences alone.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, however, it's the case that one understanding of the world is mutually incoherent with another. In this case, certain notions are context-dependent, i.e. in relation to some explanatory model. For example, H2O as a notion is only coherent in a chemistry context whereas water is only coherent in a perceptual context. In that way, both are <b>true</b> understandings of the world even though they're not mutually coherent.
</p>

<p>
Take the <i>Law of Gravity</i>, for example. From an experiential understanding of the world, interaction at a distance is impossible. All interaction is physical interaction, which entails spatial proximity. However, through an appreciation of some of the more basic principles of epistemology (like logic, math, induction, etc.) we may utilize a scientific method to explore the phenomenon of a dropped ball and draw a conclusion (viz. the existence of an invisible force) which belies our experiential understanding at one level but is derived from our experiential understanding at a more fundamental level.
</p>

<p>
What's my point? My point is to say that these foundations of understanding are reliable and rational means towards the <b>truth</b>. Though they don't offer total certainty nor mind-independent reality, they still constitute forms of knowledge and thus truth. Furthermore, this is the means by which we bridge the is/ought distinction. Once we've accepted a notion of truth, it follows that we "ought" to believe the truth. Thus, once we've scrutinized say the <i>principle of induction</i> to the greatest extent possible, if we still believe it then we've outlined good reasons for believing it. In this way, we've affirmed it's Truth by any meaningful notion of Truth.

<h2 id="org6006e3a"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Is our experiential understanding of the world reliable? Is science a sufficient replacement?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
No, there are things which are unknowable by science which we nevertheless are justified in claiming to know. Consider these five, each with varying levels of reliability:
(1) The Laws of Logic and Mathematics
(2) Basic metaphysical facts, e.g. my own existence &amp; the existence of other minds &amp; the existence of the world
(3) Ethical Judgements, especially basic truisms, e.g. that it's wrong to torture a toddler for fun
(4) Aesthetic Judgements
(5) The reliability of science as an epistemic method
</p>

<p>
We are all rational to accept these things (even if you're skeptical to the extent to which we know some of them, like aesthetic judgements) even though we don't know through scientific means.</p>
